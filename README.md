# Predicting Loan Repayment with Neural Networks
This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network model for predicting loan repayment using data from Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company. The goal of the project is to help investors identify borrowers with a high probability of repaying their loans.

## Data
The data used in this project was sourced from Lending Club and contains information on loans issued by the company. The dataset includes a variety of features such as borrower information, loan terms, and loan status (fully paid, charged off, etc.).

## Data Exploration
A significant part of the project involved exploring and understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis. This helped inform the modeling process and identify key factors that may influence loan repayment.

## Neural Network Model
The neural network model was implemented using TensorFlow and was trained to predict loan repayment based on the available features. The model was evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Conclusion
The results of the analysis show that the neural network model is able to make accurate predictions of loan repayment, with a high level of precision and recall. This can be useful for investors looking to minimize their risk when lending money through Lending Club.
