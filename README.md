# Payback Prediction with keras
## General
Lending Club is a lending company that connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor, anyone would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. (Kaggle Info) 

I created a model that is able to predict this. I used a simple neural network. 

## Dataset
